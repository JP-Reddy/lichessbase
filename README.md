Lichessbase, a Lichess clone, serves as a practical exploration into web development and database management, developed for a DBMS course project. This project has enriched my understanding of integrating and manipulating relational databases within a website context. Through Lichessbase, I've gained valuable skills in SQL, backend development, and the complexities of managing live data in a dynamic web environment."
